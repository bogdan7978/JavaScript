### JavaScript
#### It is a *Just In Time* compiled language. That is done by the engine behind browsers. To run Java on a server you need a tool like NodeJS.

### Basic Operations
`console.log('Hi mom');` - **To print**

#### Variables - *there is no need for data type annotations*

There are 7 primitive data types built-in:
- string
- number
- bigint
- boolean
- undefined
- symbol
- null

`let randomNum = 23;` - **It can be reassigned**\
`const name = 'George'` - **Cannot be assigned**\

> If a variable is defined inside a function it becomes a local variable and cannot be used outside the function
